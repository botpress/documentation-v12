## Messaging

The volume of messages contained in a single session is highly variable. It depends mainly on the targeted product, the domain, and the customers. See the following examples:

- Simple Q&A Bot:
    - Example: Covid-19 information Bot
    - #msg/session: 4-5 msgs/session

- Complex contextual Bot:
    - Example: Customer service Bot:
    - #msg/session: 10-20 msgs/session

- Special Cases (Persistent Sessions):
    - Example: Classroom bot with persistent session
    - #msg/session: 1000-5000 msgs/session

## Supported Operating Systems

- Windows 10
- Mac OS catalina or BigSur
- Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04
- Debian 8.11
- Red Hat 7.5
- CentOS 7.5

## Infrastructure Best Practices

- Use at least 2 environments (development, staging, productionâ€¦) to minimalize the impact on the end-user experience.
- Create backups and continue maintenance of all components (especially the databases and storage components to mitigate and prevent data loss). 
- Gradually execute maintenance and upgrades to ensure the system safety and its accuracy before exposing it to users (A/B, Canary deployments). For simpler implementations, predefine time ranges with low or null usage for the components maintenance. Don't forget to warn your users!
- Allocate the least privileges and accesses possible. This ensures the environment security, prevents breaches, and preserves the data integrity.
