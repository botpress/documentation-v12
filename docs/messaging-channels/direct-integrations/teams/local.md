## Requirements {#local}

### Configure Microsoft Account

Your Microsoft Account should have access to Azure and Teams. You can check out the [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops) and [Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/) documentation for information on how to make these connections.

### Configure HTTPS Endpoint

To connect to Microsoft Teams, an HTTPS endpoint is required. This is set in the `externalUrl` field in `botpress.config.json`. You can use the following methods to create this endpoint:

- Create an HTTPS tunnel to your machine using Ngrok. This tutorial works on pretty much any Operating System ([Tutorial](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok)).
- Using Nginx and Let's Encrypt. This tutorial is based on the Linux Ubuntu 16.04 Operating System ([Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04)).
- Use Serveo to create an HTTPS tunnel to your machine ([**Tutorial**](https://medium.com/automationmaster/how-to-forward-my-local-port-to-public-using-serveo-4979f352a3bf)).

:::note

To test on localhost, you can also use services like [pagekite](https://pagekite.net/) or [tunnelme](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) to expose your server.

### Before Getting Started...

Since the framework V4 is still in active development, some of these instructions may be slightly different. If you ever get stuck, check the [Official Bot Framework documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/bots/bots-create).

### Create Application & Generate Password

1. Log on to your account on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com).

2. In the Azure portal, open the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) page.

3. Click **New registration**, then choose a name for your application.

4. In the section **Supported account types**, choose **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**, then click **Register**.

5. Write down the value of `Application (client) ID`. We'll need it later for the channel configuration.

6. Click **Certificates & secrets**, then click **New client secret**, then fill in the required fields.

7. Write down the value of the generated secret.
   :::note
   You can't access it later.

### Create Your Bot

1. Navigate to the [Bot Framework Registration Page](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new) and fill in the required information:

- Display name
- Bot handle
- The Microsoft App ID (that we generated in step 1)
- Messaging endpoint (keep it blank for now - more on that later)

You can also fill the other fields as you wish, but they will not impact Botpress.

2. Click **Register**.

3. On the next page (**Connect to channels**), under the section, **Add a featured channel**, click **Configure Microsoft Teams Channel**, then click **Save**. No other configuration is needed at this point.

## Configuration

### Configure Channel on Botpress

1. Open MS Teams (either the web version or the desktop client), then start a new conversation. In the search bar, paste your Microsoft App Id. You should see your registered bot.

2. Try talking to your bot. If you get a message saying that an administrator has disabled your bot, you must enable App sideloading in your Microsoft admin portal. See this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/enable-features-office-365) for more details.

You can now continue to next [section](#setting-up-ms-teams-channel-from-an-already-configured-ms-bot-with-an-appid-and-password).

3. Edit `data/bots/<YOUR_BOT_ID>/bot.config.json`. In the `messaging.channels.teams` section write this configuration :

- `enabled`: set to `true`
- `appId`: the appId you created in when creating your teams bot
- `appPassword`: the app password you created when creating your teams bot

  Your `bot.config.json` should look like this :

```json
{
  // ... other data
  "messaging": {
    "channels": {
      "teams": {
        "enabled": true,
        "appId": "your_app_id",
        "appPassword": "your_app_password",
        // (Optional)
        "proactiveMessages": {
          "en": "proactive message",
          "fr": "message proactif",
          ...
        }
      }
      // ... other channels can also be configured here
    }
  }
}
```

### Final Configuration

1. Start Botpress, then you should see your Messaging Endpoint in the startup logs.

2. Open the [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots) page, then click the name of your bot.

3. Click the **Settings tab**, then scroll down to **Messaging endpoint**.

4. Set the value of the endpoint that was displayed in the logs. If it is missing, it should looks like that:

`<EXTERNAL_URL>/api/v1/messaging/webhooks/<YOUR_BOT_ID/teams`
