## Setup {#cloud}

### Generate an Authorization Token

When you create a Telegram bot, Botfather will automatically generate a token. The token is a string that is required to authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API. Keep your token secure and store it safely; anyone can use it to control your bot.

If your existing token is compromised or you lost it for some reason, use the `/token` command to generate a new one.

## Configuration

1. Copy the token from botfather and paste it into `bot_token` fields
2. Click save at the bottom right

:::caution
Normally the Webhook URL should be auto-populate. If it's not populated, the button `deploy to cloud` was not pressed.
