:::info

Due to the large interest in the Cloud beta, we've added a few constraints to ensure a smooth experience for all users:

- 3 chatbots max per developer account
- Cloud-native chatbots only, i.e., bots created on Botpress v12.27.0-beta and later. Existing chatbots should not be ported to the Cloud Beta due to differences in the Cloud SDK.
- English language only chatbots
- Small-to-moderate-sized chatbots only. Chatbots with an excess number of intents, flows, actions, etc., will get an error message on the beta."

# Introduction

Botpress Cloud is the only open-source chatbot deployment solution on the cloud and provides an easy one-click deployment feature. Our new platform will rapidly reduce the time and money spent on typical chatbot deployments. Plus, it’s entirely open-source, giving developers complete flexibility and zero vendor lock-in.
