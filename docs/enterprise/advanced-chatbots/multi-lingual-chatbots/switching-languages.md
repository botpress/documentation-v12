Switching languages in your Botpress instance is very easy.

:::note
Don't forget to take a look at the [supported languages](/building-chatbots/language-understanding/supported-languages).

## Switch Language

1. At the bottom right, next to the name of your bot, click the language flag.
2. Select the desired language.

You'll see a `missing translation` notification on your content.

## Translate Your Content

1. Click the **Flow** tab.
1. Find the node that you want to translate.
1. Edit the text in the **Inspector**.
   :::tip
   You can click the info button ![info-button](/assets/info-button.png) and it pastes the message in the default language.
   :::
1. Write a translation (where your text is red with **(missing translation)** next to it).

You can now manage your content.

:::info
You can't create the original content in another language than the default one. You will have this message displayed:
