# ŸêAbout Misunderstood
The misunderstood module holds infromation about the user messages that were misunderstood by the chatbot and it is available only for an activated bot.

## How does it work?
The chatbot determines that it didn't understand the user in three ways:
1. Big ambiguty between two or more intents with nearly the same confidence when matching what the user said


2. When what the user said didn't match with any intent, a "none" intent is selected by the chatbot


4. When a QnA is fired, and the user clickd on the "thumbs down" emoji

## Continous Learning
By checking the misunderstood module, you gurantee that your bot is continously learning and growing.
When a user input is identified as a misunderstood then we can do one of two things:

### Automatic Utterance Clustering
In order to make it easier for our builder (conversation designers, developers, etc.) we have added a new functionality in the misunderstood module, which is the automatic utterance clustering. When a builder click an utterance to take a decision about, the user statements are reordered to push all the matching/similar statements to the one the builder have chose. 

So for example, below are the misunerstood statements:

We can see, food related statements are in the middle, when we select one of them, it is pushed up to the top along with other matching/similar statements:

### Amend
You can amend your intent(s) or QnA(s) utternaces with what was not understood

### Ignore
You can choose to ignore a statement, so it is not logged again as a misunderstood

## Misunderstood Statments Statuses
In general the misunderstood statements are categorized in three categories:
